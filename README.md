TO-DO

Say something in display to indicate you can do these inputs.
    Can say something like "nbd2" and also something like "r2d3". 
    Would be like: if string length == 4
    if string[1] == letter then look use only the piece on that column
    elseif string[1] == number then only use piece on that row.
    Easy peasy.

    Can say something like "d2"
    would be like: if string length == 2
    Add "p" to the beginning of the string.
